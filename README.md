## Installation

### Option 1 (Recommended):

-   Download the compiled version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Najmul190/Jade-Bot-Status/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
-   Run the executable file, and it'll ask you to set-up a few options and will automatically start running your Rich Presence.

### Option 2 (For Developers):

-   Clone the repository
-   Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-   Run the `main.py` file, and it'll ask you to set-up a few options and will automatically start running your Rich Presence.

After you've done either of the above, your Rich Presence should be up and running. If you have any issues, feel free to open an [issue on this repository](https://github.com/Najmul190/Jade-Bot-Status/issues).

## FAQ:

How do I get my referral link?

-   You can get your referral link by heading over to your subscription of Jadebot at [Whop](https://whop.com/orders/products/), clicking the 3 dots on the right and clicking `Refer friends`.
-   Your link will now be copied to your clipboard, and you can paste it in the terminal when asked. (e.g. `https://whop.com/marketplace/jadebot/?a=najmul190`)

What does turning on `Start with System` do?

-   This will make the program run on startup, so you don't have to manually run it every time you turn on your computer, and it'll automatically start running in the background.

I messed up my referral link, how do I change it?

-   You can change your referral link by going to `%appdata%\Roaming` and editing the link. (Everything before `||`)
